# ðŸŽ¯ Ramsey Theory & Pseudorandom Graph Exploration

This project is a computational exploration of **Ramsey theory** through the lens of **pseudorandom graphs** and **spectral graph analysis**. We aim to combine recent theoretical advances with algorithmic experimentation to better understand and simulate Ramsey-related phenomena.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Ramsey theory studies unavoidable patterns in large structuresâ€”like how any sufficiently large graph must contain monochromatic cliques in any edge coloring. Our focus is on:

- Simulating **pseudorandom graphs**.
- Verifying their **spectral properties**.
- Testing Ramsey-related behavior like **monochromatic clique existence** in **colored graphs**.

## ðŸ§ª Phases of the Project

### âœ… Phase 1: Pseudorandom Graph Generation & Spectral Verification
- Generated *d*-regular graphs using NetworkX.
- Calculated the **second-largest eigenvalue (Î»â‚‚)** of the adjacency matrix.
- Verified pseudorandomness via spectral norm conditions:  
  `â€–A - (d/n)Jâ€– â‰¤ Î»`
- Interpreted spectral gaps as indicators of randomness.

### âœ… Phase 2: Edge Coloring & Ramsey Problem Setup
- Randomly colored the edges of the graph (2-coloring).
- Visualized edge coloring using red and blue.
- Goal: Identify or simulate potential **monochromatic cliques**, which ties directly to bounds on Ramsey numbers.

## ðŸš€ Final Goal

We aim to **experimentally validate small Ramsey instances** and simulate their behavior using:
- Pseudorandom graph models.
- Spectral conditions.
- SAT solver integration (future phase).
- Comparisons against known Ramsey number bounds.

The long-term vision includes:
- Extending to **3-color problems**.
- Automating search for large cliques.
- Generating statistics on random graphs' Ramsey behavior.
